The dnsreflector daemon listens for DNS queries on a local UDP port and
answers with records pointing back to localhost. Combined with pf(4) this
works as a bandwidth efficient spamtrap.

This program was written and tested with OpenBSD. If you are interested
in running dnsreflector on another platform, please contact me.
